We can store the negative and positive lexicons in two separate char arrays.
For each review, we check each word per review to see if they exist as a positive/negative lexicon.
If (exists), increment positive or decrement neg. 

We can use strstr() in <string.h> library to check if it exists. I think it will return null if if does
not exist.

So, first, someone needs to store the two lexicon txt files 
into a char array (2 separate c files: one for positive and other for negative)

Then, when you have time, please start writing the functions and filling in the 'idk' constraints.


okies :) good luck.
